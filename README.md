### Hi there, I'm Teddy 👋

## What do I do?

**I'm a full-stack web and mobile developer based in Paris, France.**

After 4 years working in marketing for the B2B tech industry I decided to make a career switch to web development. 🚀 

I realized I wanted to work on more concrete, technical projects. I have since worked on developing these skills with a focus on JavaScript and the React and React Native frontend libraries. 👨‍💻 

I'm currently looking for my next job opportunity as a developper! 👨‍💼
