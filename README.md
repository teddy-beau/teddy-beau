# Hi there, I'm Teddy 👋

## About me

**I'm a full-stack developer based in Lyon, France.** 🇫🇷 

After several years working in marketing for the B2B tech industry I decided back in 2020 to make a career switch to web development! 🚀 

I realized I wanted to work on more concrete, technical projects. I have since worked on developing these skills with a focus on TypeScript and React.js frontend library, as well as NodeJS for the backend. 👨‍💻 

## What I do
- ⚛️&nbsp;&nbsp;React.js with Next.js
- 🎨&nbsp;&nbsp;Tailwind CSS
- ⚙️&nbsp;&nbsp;Node.js with Express and Nest
- 💾&nbsp;&nbsp;MongoDB & MySQL/Postgre
- 🧪&nbsp;&nbsp;Jest, Playwright

## What I'm currently doing
Beside my current job at French proptech startup [Zefir](https://www.zefir.fr/) I'm working on a personal project that consists in a new and enhanced version of the website of a cheesemaker. The old website was a simple Wordpress but the new version is built with Next.js and comes with a tailored admin back-office. The main features include:
- Static and server side rendered pages
- Shopping cart allowing to place an order
- Order confirmation email sent to customer and admin with Nodemailer
- Store locator using Mapbox GL
- Authentication to the admin back-office to create and manage products, orders, store locations...
- PDF delivery note generation based on an order
- and much more...
