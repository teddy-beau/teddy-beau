# Hi there, I'm Teddy 👋

## About me

**I'm a full-stack web and mobile developer based in Paris, France.** 🇫🇷 

After 4 years working in marketing for the B2B tech industry I decided to make a career switch to web development! 🚀 

I realized I wanted to work on more concrete, technical projects. I have since worked on developing these skills with a focus on JavaScript + TypeScript and the React.js and React Native frontend libraries, but I also work with NodeJS for the backend. 👨‍💻 

## What I do
- ⚛️&nbsp;&nbsp;React.js with Next.js
- 📱&nbsp;&nbsp;React Native with Expo
- ⚙️&nbsp;&nbsp;Node.js with Express 
- 💾&nbsp;&nbsp;MongoDB & MySQL
- and also some Jest and more!

## What I'm currently doing
Beside my current job at French insurtech startup [Acheel](https://www.acheel.com/) I'm working on a personal project that consists in a new and enhanced version of the website of a cheesemaker. The old website is a simple Wordpress but the new version is built with Next.js and comes with a tailored admin back-office. The main features include:
- Static and server side rendered pages
- Shopping cart allowing to place an order
- Order confirmation email sent to customer and admin with Nodemailer
- Store locator using Mapbox GL
- Authentication to the admin back-office to create and manage products, orders, store locations...
- PDF delivery note generation based on an order
- and much more...
