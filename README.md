# Hi there, I'm Teddy 👋

## About me

**I'm a full-stack web and mobile developer based in Paris, France.** 🇫🇷 

After 4 years working in marketing for the B2B tech industry I decided to make a career switch to web development! 🚀 

I realized I wanted to work on more concrete, technical projects. I have since worked on developing these skills with a focus on JavaScript and the React and React Native frontend libraries, but I also work with NodeJS for the backend. 👨‍💻 

## What I do
- ⚛️&nbsp;&nbsp;React and NextJS
- 📱&nbsp;&nbsp;React Native with Expo
- ⚙️&nbsp;&nbsp;NodeJS with Express
- 💾&nbsp;&nbsp;MongoDB
- and also some Redux, Gatsby, Jest, and more!
